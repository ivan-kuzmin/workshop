                        The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM) has established itself as the world’s premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high performance computing. By promoting novel, high quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, the conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels.

                            Recent breakthroughs in machine learning, especially deep neural networks and tensor networks, extend far beyond their original purpose. It is expected that physicians will be able to completely rely on the machine interpretation of MRIs, CT, PET scans using deep learning in the nearest future. Same aspiration exists with regard to detection of disease-specific patterns in EEG/MEG time series data and to automated histopathology of brain tissue samples. Combined together, these methodologies look at the brain at all possible angles and scales and, thus, they are becoming more than just diagnostic tools. These approaches show promise in alleviating early detection of mental disorders and brain cancers, accelerate the search for life-saving pharmaceuticals, and provide insights about the molecular pathways of the neurodegenerative diseases.

                            Deep neural networks have revolutionized computer vision through the end-to-end learning (i.e., learning from the raw data), but also emphasized the need for development of optimization techniques in order to work with the Big Data in the most efficient way. It is because of the lack of such techniques that the early detection of the major neurodegenerative diseases (such as ADHD, Autism, or Alzheimer’s) is still difficult to accomplish with the neural networks today. In these conditions, very large-scale brain imagery datasets and the time-series data are accompanied by the abundance of the expression tests from the established and experimental neurological biomarkers which routinely appear in the research laboratories today.  For example, recent breakthroughs in the -omix and gene editing tools (such as Crispr/Cas9) have enabled experimentation with biomarkers in a very vast parameter space, yet again emphasizing the acute need for efficient deep learning approaches and universally applicable analytics.

                            One promising paradigm to address the challenge is to rely on the recently reported scalable framework of tensor neural networks. Such “tensor train” approach constructs a simple and shallow neural network that compresses a large number of network weight parameters, effectively alleviating the inherent curse of dimensionality problem. The “tensor trains” are naturally capable of extracting the essential and discriminative features from the whole-brain fMRI/CT imagery, the associated time-series EEG/MEG data, and the accompanying biomarker assays.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The workshop is oriented to all potential applications of deep learning and tensor networks in feature extraction, classification, recognition, segmentation, enhancing, clustering, anomaly detection, and prediction of neurodegenerative disease states – as applied to the multi-modal brain data (MRI/fMRI/CT, EEG/MEG, and biomarker assays).  Special focus will be made on the practical aspects of how to design and train tensor neural networks with appropriate reduction of the dimensionality. Subjects of visualization of the informative brain features using a dynamic view of the brain patterns and feature selection methods involved in each of the disease states will also be covered
